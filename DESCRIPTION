Description: Calculate NOS (node overlap and segregation) and
    the associated metrics described in Strona and Veech (2015)
    <doi:10.1111/2041-210X.12395> and Strona et al. (2018) 
    <doi:10.1111/ecog.03447>. The functions provided in the 
    package enable assessment of structural patterns ranging from
    complete node segregation to perfect nestedness in a variety 
    of network types. In addition, they provide a measure of 
    network modularity.
